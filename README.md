# My-Code-Library

## About This Repository
This repository serves as a living portfolio of my journey into software development and security. It houses the scripts I have built to learn and understand different programming languages, ranging from foundational logic to practical security applications.

## 🛠️ What's Inside?
* **Security & Encryption:** Scripts exploring how data is encrypted and decrypted.
* **Data Processing:** Practical use of loops and list iteration to manage data.
* **Fundamentals:** Creation of scripts to understand foundational logic.

## 🚀 Goals
To demonstrate proficiency in writing clean, efficient code for IT and Security Operations.
